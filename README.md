### 🧩 Data Model Structure

**Data Sources**
- `SalesData2020` – Transactional sales records  
- `ReturnData` – Returned item details  
- `CustomerInformation` – Demographic and behavioral data  
- `ProductInformation`, `ProductCategory`, `ProductSubCategory` – Product hierarchy and attributes

### ⚙️ Key DAX Measures
- `Total Sales` = SUMX(SalesData, SalesData[OrderQuantity] * RELATED(ProductInformation[ProductPrice]))  
- `Total Profit` = [Total Sales] - [Total Cost]  
- `Profit Margin (%)` = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales])  
- `Return Rate (%)` = DIVIDE([Total Units Returns], [Total Units Sold])  
- `YoY Growth`, `MoM Growth`, `YTD Sales`, `Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)`
